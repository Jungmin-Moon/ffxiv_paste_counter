# FFXIV Paste Counter Script

A simple script to automate adding paste the player receives upon finishing a certain piece of content in game. <br />
With a menu of options that I expect to be the most common ways people get paste. <br />

# How to use
Please have the latest version of Python on your system. <br />
Download the release and save the zip somewhere. <br />
Take the script out of the zip and put it wherever. <br />
Open command prompt and navigate to wherever the script is. <br />
Type: python paste_counter.py <br />
Go wild or don't. <br />

# Why am I making this?
Because I wanted to practice Python.

# Can't I just count manually?
Yes, but I don't want to count manually. <br />
I would rather enter a number for the menu and hit enter instead to let the script calculate everything.

# Am I just lazy?
Yes very much so.
