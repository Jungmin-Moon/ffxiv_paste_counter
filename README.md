# FFXIV Paste Counter Script

A simple script to automate adding paste the player receives upon finishing a certain piece of content in game. <br />
With a menu of options that I expect to be the most common ways people get paste. <br />


# Why am I making this?
Because I wanted to practice Python.

# Can't I just count manually?
Yes, but I don't want to count manually. I would rather enter a number for the menu and hit enter instead to let the script calculate everything.

# Am I just lazy?
Yes very much so.
